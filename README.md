This is my Intro To Programming Project 

##PROJECT TITLE: SnackBar
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: SnackBar is a simple Java program that simulates a snack bar with a snack machine and students.

##VERSION or DATE: 09/12/2022

##HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
* The SnackBar class contains a main method that creates a new SnackBar object and runs it for a given number of time steps.

 */* The SnackBar class has the following fields:

* A Random object that is used to generate random numbers.
* An array of strings containing the names of the different flavours of crisps.
* A SnackMachine object that represents the snack machine in the snack bar.
* An ArrayList of Student objects representing the students in the snack bar.
* The SnackBar class also has a describe method that prints the state of the snack bar to the console, including the number of students and the number of packets of each flavour of crisps in the snack machine.

* The runSnackBar method is used to run the snack.
